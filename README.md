## Status

This module is fully functional for managing notes. It installs successfully on FreePBX 13 and utilizes features exclusive to version 15, such as backup and restore.

## Scope

This module aims to strike a balance between demonstrating key functionality and avoiding overwhelming complexity. The following tasks are covered:

These methods are mandatory, even if not utilized:
